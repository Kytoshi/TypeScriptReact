# ✨ Valorant Instalock Game ✨

## Welcome to the Valorant Lobby...

#### Today is the day you finally get to play a game of VALORANT. You hop on and, Oh No! You got queued into a bunch of Instalockers 😨
#### Here's your chance to prove your superior game knowledge to them to get them to back off your agent pick. But be careful... if they deem you as noob, you will be put on Pocket Sage Duty 😭
